                        As human development rises, deforestation does too.
                        Deforestation is the act of cutting down trees and
                        shrubs to make room for new growth. It can also be
                        explained as the purposeful clearing of forest land.

                        What is causing deforestation?

                    <p className="text-white text-md font-space-grotesk">
                        Deforestation is fueled by agriculture and wood
                        extraction. Mining is another cause of deforestation,
                        since trees need to be removed in order to break the
                        soil. Climate change is also a big factor in
                        deforestation. Since the climate is hotter, wildfires
                        are more likely to occur and therefore burning more
                        trees.

                        Why is deforestation bad?

                    <p className="text-white text-md font-space-grotesk">
                        Deforestation contributes to the loss of animal and
                        plant habitats. When a forest is cut down, animals are
                        displaced and if they don&apos; find another habitat,
                        they die. Another effect of deforestation is the
                        increase of greenhouse gases. Since trees produce
                        oxygen, cutting them down reduces the amount of oxygen
                        and increases the amount of carbon dioxide.

                        Common solutions to deforestation include passing of
                        laws that state how much and which trees you can cut
                        down, reforestation, which is plating more trees, and
                        sustainable alternatives for tree based products.
