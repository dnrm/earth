                        Air pollution is when particles of compounds are
                        released into the air. These particles are harmful to
                        any living organism, including humans. In the last
                        years, air pollution has become a major threat to the
                        human population. Cities such as Gurugram India, Mexico
                        City Mexico, Monterrey Mexico, etc. are already having
                        to implement preventive measures.

                        Air pollution is caused by the release of harmful gases
                        in the air. These gases come from cars, factories,
                        trucks, and other emissions. Even aerosols release
                        harmful chemicals. Another really big cause for air
                        pollution is the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and
                        gasoline.

                        Air pollution is bad because of the harmful health

                        prevent plants from performing photosynthesis. Air
